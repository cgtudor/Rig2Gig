<h3>4. Collection and processing of personal data</h3>
<p>The term 'personal data' refers to such information which, directly or indirectly, may refer to you as an individual. Examples of such data are name, image, personal ID number, contact details. Personal data processing refers to any action that we or a third party that we have engaged take with the personal data, such as collection, registration and storage. Personal data may only be processed for specified and explicitly stated purposes and may not be subsequently processed for any purpose that goes beyond these purposes. At Rig2Gig, we process personal data that you have given us for the sole purpose of administering inquiries and agreements from/with you, as well as providing information and services in connection with such inquiries and agreements. For example, this may concern registration of interest for our rental accommodation, for competitions advertised on our application and which you choose to participate in, or subscriptions to our newsletters which you have ordered. Your personal data may also be used for marketing and follow up as well as for our sales and product development with the aim of improving our products and services. In the event that you do not wish to receive marketing and/or any offers, please contact us via the contact details listed under Contact information below. Finally, personal data is also processed for statistical purposes to see how users use the application and to analysis search behavior, as well as to display content customized for you. Such data is, however, only processed in aggregated form or in a form that cannot identify you as an individual. Data is also processed indirectly in connection with the development, testing and administration of the IT systems underlying our application. When using features on our application that allow you to post information or other material on it, please note that such information may also contain personal data. In the event that your information contains data about other individuals, you may only post such data which you have received their consent to provide.</p>
<h3>5. Limitations</h3>
<p>In no event shall Rig2Gig or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use Rig2Gig, even if Rig2Gig or a Rig2Gig authorised representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.</p>
